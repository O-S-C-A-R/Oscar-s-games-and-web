      <div><p>You exited the engine room with your partner. You moved down a hallway that leads to the common room of the space ship. You peeked throught the door window of the common room, and you see one of your crew members, being lifted off he's feet by a fleshy tentacle arm. He kept screaming in fear, and you stood there frozen, watching as another tentacle penatrated his chest, ending the scream.</p></div>
