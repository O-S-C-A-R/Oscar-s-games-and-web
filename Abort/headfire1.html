      <div><p>You're running to the head of the ship, just as you were reaching there, the self destruct alarm sounded. You made it to the head of the ship, and found out that you weren't the only survivor... "You're still alive? I already started the self destruct count down! I had to, this monster is smart enough to break out of a highly secured cage, if I don't destroy this ship with it, who knows what it could do next! Now, the alien probably knows the source of all the alarms, when it gets in here, you escort to the escape pod, and I will shut the door, NOW QUICKLY, IT'S HERE!" The captain threw a flash grenade on the floor and fired at the monster while flashing light at it, the monster shrieked and rushed at the captain.<p></div>
