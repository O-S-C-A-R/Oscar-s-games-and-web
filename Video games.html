      <div><p>I came home from school one day, and I saw my mother holding an odd device. It wasn't a phone, and it was laptop top. In fact, it looked like it was both combined. An i pad was what I saw. And the first thing I saw my mom do with it, was playing a game. It was an game where you had to match the plane to a runway using your fingers, according to its color. From then on, I played more and more I pad games. Some games were popular among my friends, and some games were for me to play when Im bored, and have no wifi. Playing with the I pad became a major addiction for me, and it was a huge problem to me. I didn't get to study alot, and my mind was full of fantasies that I'd conjure because of the games I've played.</p></div>
