      <div><p>My dad has always wanted me to get into programming. He loves computer science himself, and despite the limited resources he had at the time, he still strives to understand it due to hes love for it. In our current times, the advancement of technology is growing at a quick rate, and more and more things are being developed. And thanks to our technological advancements and the available resources we have, There are many easy ways to learn how code, and pick up on it fast. One of these ways is to code with Tynker, an app that can be downloaded on mobile devices for free. Looking the the top photo, it looks like a kids game. In fact, it is a kids game, and its meant to teach kids how to code. And no I didn't play with this app as a kid, but I merely started only 3 years ago. You probably see coding as a really complicated course, with all the syntaxes, and wierd punctuations involved in it. But in tynker, your coding tools are merely building blocks, with pre-built in codes. From that, you get the fundemantles of coding, and telling things what to do with a computer. Tynker will do exactly what you want it to do, even if thats not what you really want.</p> </div>

      <div><p>After finding out that Tynker was a little too easy for me, I moved on to hopscotch. It was the exact same thing as tynker, accept that there are more features and functions in it. In hopscotch, you can code games or other cool things, and post it online. Other people will be able to see your projects, and you will be able to see their projects. Another cool thing about hopscotch is the fact that not only will you be able to see another persons project, but you also get to see the code and program behind it and further develop your coding skills. In tynker, there are story modes and quests that you have to pay for, but in hopscotch, the learning experience is all free.</p></div>

      <div><p>Hopscotch may have more features and functions than tynker, but in the end, it's still pretty much the exact thing. All you do is stack blocks that tells your video game characters what to do. People who plays with hopscotch may understand the concept of programming, but due to the limitations of the apps, there is only so much you can do. The next step was to learn the programming langguage that powers our every day uses, like computers, or home heaters. And the very first programming langguage I have ever learn, and I'm still far from mastering it, is C. But what exactly am I programming? Arduino. Arduino is micro-controller that is designed by italians to make coding and electrical technology easy to understand. The program is free to download, and the microcontroller only costs 18 dollars. And with something so cheap, you can learn very much. Anyone can pick up an arduino, hook it up to a computer or a laptop, and make any</p></div>
