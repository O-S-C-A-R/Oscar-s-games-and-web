      <div><p>As a little kid, I was that typical little boy who colored in coloring books. I've never drawn anything at the time, because I didn't know how. And like other little kids, there would be that one movie, or tv show, that they think is so cool, that they would want to draw it. For me, that movie, was Transformers. Transformers was the movie that got me wanting to draw it. I treasured the body design of every transformer, and I enjoyed watching them fight, and cause hardcore destruction around them. I even bought picture books of them, and CDs of the old animated transformers series. I would take my picture book, and try to draw every little detail in them. After doing that for a while, I eventually started drawing my own robots. After Transformers, next came those typical movies with warriors, knights, and fantasy themed fighters. I thought their armors were cool, and I enjoyed trying to draw cool looking armor. Most of these armor and warriors that I drew were inspired by characters in a japanese trading card game, or chinese warriors in a video game. A few months went by, and an app named Instagram was introduced to me. I'm sure you know what it is. You can post pictures and videos, and friends and strangers can give it a like, or they can follow you. I tried it out, and posted dumb pictures and screenshots. I then got the idea to post pictures of my drawings. But these weren't my own fantasies, they were drawings of cartoons that I watch on Disney Channel or Cartoon Network. I kept drawing cartoon characters that I liked, and my drawings got better and better. I continued drawing characters that I love, but this time, I tried shading them according to the shadows casted on them. I started drawing 3d characters, and shaded them really well. I have colored my drawings before, and shaded them with fancy pens and pencils that I get as birthday presents. In the end, I decided that drawing with a single pencil was the best. One day, my friend came up to me, and asked me to draw the things that he wanted for money. More and more people wanted my drawings, but due to finals and all that, I couldn't finish them all. When the summer holidays started, my dad bought me a drawing tablet that I could hook up to a laptop and use it draw. I am currently still learning all the things that it can do, and thats where my journey of drawing ends.</p></div>
